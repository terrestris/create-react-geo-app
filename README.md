# create-react-geo-app (CRGA)

[![Lint, typecheck, build, run and e2e test the CRGA](https://github.com/terrestris/create-react-geo-app/actions/workflows/full-check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/terrestris/create-react-geo-app/actions/workflows/full-check.yml)

A command line interface to quickly create a [`react-geo`](https://github.com/terrestris/react-geo)
based web GIS application based on a [comprehensive template](https://github.com/terrestris/react-geo-client-template).
There is probably no easier way to get started with `react-geo` or to bootstrap an
application using it.

## tl;dr

```
npx @terrestris/create-react-geo-app my-react-geo-app
```

## Requirements

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx)
or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), both usually come with Node.js.

## Usage without installation âš¡

```
npx @terrestris/create-react-geo-app my-react-geo-app
```

Creates a new `react-geo` application in the `my-react-geo-app`-folder. Perfectly fine
for one time usages.

## Global installation

### Installation ðŸ’¾

Once:

```
npm install -g @terrestris/create-react-geo-app
```

You can then use the new `create-react-geo-app` command, e.g.:

```
create-react-geo-app my-react-geo-app
```

The result is the same as the `tl;dr` example from above, but the `npm install`-way is
recommended if you regularily use the `create-react-geo-app` program. Pick one way or
the other, there is not much you can do wrong here.


### Update ðŸš€

```
npm update -g @terrestris/create-react-geo-app
```

### Uninstalling ðŸ˜”

```
npm uninstall -g @terrestris/create-react-geo-app
```

## Syntax

In a directory of your choice, say `/code`:

```
create-react-geo-app my-react-geo-app [options]
```

Will result in a folder `/code/my-react-geo-app`, which contains a nice react-geo
application. You can use this as the starting pont for your specific project needs.


## Options

* `-V`, `--version` Output the version number
* `-g`, `--git-init` Whether to init an empty git repository or not (default: `false`)
* `-t`, `--tag` The `react-geo-client-template` version/tag, wil use the latest version if
not provided
* `-h`, `--help` Display help for command


## Developing


### Installing dependencies

To get the dependencies, run

```
npm install
```

in the project root.

### Running a development version

If you want to use your variant of the program (probably with changed source taking
effect), run

```
npm link
```

`create-react-geo-app` anywhere will now point to your locally built program.

### Typechecking

Easy:

```
npm run typecheck
```

### Linting and testing

For linting only,

```
npm run lint
```

is your friend. This will also be called when running `npm test`.

We currently have no tests for the CLI, but would be happy to receive PRs in that
direction.

## Contributing

In short: yes, please contribute as you see fit ðŸ˜Š, we're looking forward to your input.

Be bold and open PRs and issues for anything that bugs you or for all the ideas you want
